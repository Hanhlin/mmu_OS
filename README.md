# mmu_OS
This lab implements the operation of virtual memory manager in operating system, which maps virtual address spaces of multiple processes on physical frames using page table translation. 

The following are six page replacement algorithms implemented:
1) FIFO (first in first out)
2) Random
3) Clock
4) Enhanced Second Chance
5) Aging
6) Working Set

Each process has virtual address space of exactly 64 virtual pages. 

Note that is only support up to 128 frames.
